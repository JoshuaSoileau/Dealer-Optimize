### Remember that girl you dated in college, the crazy one?

The one who ***stole the knit sweater your grandma made you***, so she could stuff it with toilet paper and sleep with it at night?
Who changed ***your*** relationship status on facebook to "engaged" after you'd been on 2 dates?

That girl was crazy.

### Is your dealership's website doing the same thing?

Listen, we all want more leads.

I get it.

If I have more ways of allowing the user to contact us, I'll get more leads.

## WRONG

You think you're being helpful, incentivizing the users to get personal, human interaction from your team.

You are actually strangling them.

Most dealership's websites have *far far too much going on*.

Let's try and remember what the user actually wants out of your website.

- They want to view cars.
- They want to tell the important specs of the cars.
- They want to know the cars history, mileage, MPG.
- They want honest, up front pricing information.

They want to do research. **They don't want to be bombarded with sales from the getgo.**

Having 36 methods of getting their contact information isn't helping you, it's hurting you.

**YOU** want to help more people find their dream car, but what actually happens is that having a website as intense as this *ruins any amount of trust you could hope to build.*

Here's the thing. **The fix for this is DEAD SIMPLE**.

### I'll tell you how to do it right now, step by step.

You've probably got at least 4 or 5 lead gen forms on your VLP or VDP.

Here's the solution.

1. **Determine which lead gen method is most effective on your homepage, vehicle listing page, and vehicle details page.**
Take an analytics deep dive, determine which form on every given page is used the most by the visitors.

2. **Run an *A/B test* where you emphasize that contact method more, and emphasize every other ones less (or just remove them).**
Do **NOT** just make changes willy-nilly. Test them. You need to know for a fact whether or not any given change was good or bad. *If you just throw up / tear down pieces of your website on a whim, you could be butchering yourself.*

3. **Wait a few weeks while your website gets enough traffic to validate success or failure.** You'll need a few thousand visitors before you can say for certain whether or not a test is complete.

4. **Gather QUANTITATIVE data on the number of leads before and after the changes, and validate whether or not the changes were worthwhile.**

I've seen dealerships **literally double** the number of leads they get from their VDP by emphasizing what works and removing what doesn't.

Here's something to keep in mind when deciding what changes to make.

Every page should have a primary goal and maybe a secondary goal.
Usually it's something like *1. Provide user with relevant vehicle information. 2. Ask user to reach out for assistance.*

A recent study found that 61% of buyers buy cars without
